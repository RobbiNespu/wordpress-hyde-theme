# Hyde theme

Hyde is a brazen two-column theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with
uncomplicated content. It's based the [Hyde theme for
Jekyll](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) and ported to Wordpress. I tries to be a
1-on-1 as most as possible. I tried to keep the html & css for the original
Hyde theme and this Wordpress port mostly the same.
